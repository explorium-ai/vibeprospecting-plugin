name: clean-data
description: Triage, standardize, and validate a CSV, Excel, or JSON list of companies or contacts before enrichment. Profile fill rate and cardinality, normalize company names and domains, validate emails and phones, tag invalid rows non-destructively. Run before match-business or match-prospects so you do not pay to enrich noreply, disposable, or empty rows.

# Clean Data

Per-row cleanup on a GTM list before any match or enrich call. Profile, standardize, validate. Never destructive: raw input is preserved, invalid rows are tagged with reason codes rather than deleted. Out of scope: deduplication and canonical entity resolution.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` is a path to a CSV, Excel, or JSON file. Parse the user message into this canonical shape before starting the workflow:

```json
{
  "schema_hints": {
    "company": "<col_name or null>",
    "domain":  "<col_name or null>",
    "email":   "<col_name or null>",
    "phone":   "<col_name or null>",
    "country": "<col_name or null>",
    "name":    "<col_name or null>"
  },
  "default_country": "<ISO Alpha-2 or null>",
  "entity_type": "companies | contacts | both | infer",
  "mx_check": false,
  "match_ready": false
}
```

**Echo the parsed shape back to the user as the first log line** so they can correct any misreads before the workflow burns time on wrong column assumptions. Defaults: `entity_type=infer`, `mx_check=false`, `match_ready=false`, `default_country=null`. Field-specific behavior:
- `schema_hints` — used to map source columns to canonical fields. Required when column names are ambiguous or non-English (`firma`, `kontakt`, `tel`, `land`).
- `default_country` — flows into phone normalization (`phonenumbers` country hint) for rows where the country column is blank.
- `mx_check` — adds DNS lookup per email domain (50-200ms/domain). Off by default.
- `match_ready` — when true, also emit the `04_match_ready/` subset for downstream entity resolution.

Example phrasings:

- "Clean this leads CSV before I import it to HubSpot."
- "Normalize the company names and domains in /path/accounts.xlsx."
- "Validate the emails in this file and tag the bad rows."
- "Prep this list for prospect matching, only keep contactable corporate rows."
- "Why does my country column have 200 different spellings."

## Workflow

1. **Copy raw input.** Before any transform, copy the input to `./00_raw/<filename>` and never write back. All transforms write to numbered phase folders: `01_profiled/`, `02_standardized/`, `03_validated/`. The single most common failure mode in cleanup work is destructive transforms with no path back.

2. **Profile the file.** Compute fill rate, cardinality, top values, length distribution, and format-pattern frequency for every column. Save the snapshot. Read it before deciding what to clean.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv(input_path)
   profile = pd.DataFrame({
       "fill_rate_pct": (df.notna().mean() * 100).round(1),
       "cardinality": df.nunique(),
       "top_value": df.apply(lambda c: c.dropna().astype(str).mode().iloc[0] if c.dropna().size else None),
       "avg_len": df.apply(lambda c: c.dropna().astype(str).str.len().mean()),
   })
   ```

   Things to look for: country columns with 200+ distinct values (standardization problem, build ISO Alpha-2 lookup); phone columns where under 50% parse as E.164 (need country hint); company-name 99th-percentile length above 100 chars (pasted addresses, quarantine); free-email providers in the top 5 of email column (decide policy now); fields under 10% fill (probably not worth normalizing); literal strings `"NA"`, `"N/A"`, `"None"`, `"null"`, `"-"` (collapse to real nulls before validating).

3. **Standardize string fields.** Run standardization BEFORE validation: a valid email like ` JOHN@ACME.COM ` fails naive regex without trim+lowercase first. For every string column do Unicode NFKC, trim, collapse internal whitespace, strip leading and trailing punctuation, collapse null-token strings to real nulls. Then field-specific:

   - **Company name.** Strip legal suffixes (`Inc`, `LLC`, `Ltd`, `GmbH`, `S.A.`, `株式会社`) at end of string only. Use `cleanco` if available. Keep BOTH raw and normalized columns.
   - **Domain.** Strip protocol and `www`. Fold to the eTLD+1 via `tldextract`. Flag free-email providers and disposable domains separately.
   - **Person name.** Parse with `nameparser`: honorifics, generational suffixes, credentials, particles. **Flag as low-confidence when ANY of the following:** (a) nameparser returns no first or no last; (b) the string contains CJK or Hangul characters; (c) the surname token matches a known surname-first list (`Wang`, `Li`, `Zhang`, `Liu`, `Chen`, `Yang`, `Zhao`, `Wu`, `Kim`, `Park`, `Lee`, `Choi`, `Jung`, `Nguyen`, `Tran`, `Le`, `Pham`, `Hoang`, `Yamada`, `Tanaka`, `Suzuki`, `Sato`) AND the input has only two whitespace-separated tokens — nameparser will silently invert family-first names like `Wang Xiaoming` or `Kim Min-jun`; (d) the string ends with a credential suffix (PhD, MD, Esq., CPA). **On low-confidence, store BOTH the nameparser interpretation AND the swapped interpretation** as `name_first` / `name_last` and `name_first_alt` / `name_last_alt`, so the downstream match step can try both orderings. Raw string is always preserved alongside.
   - **Phone.** Format to E.164 with `phonenumbers`. Hint country from the country column when available.
   - **Country.** Use `pycountry` for canonical ISO 3166-1 lookup (common name + alpha2 + alpha3) plus a bundled `country_aliases.yaml` for non-English exonyms (`Deutschland`, `Allemagne`, `République française`, `中国`, `日本`). **Pre-strip non-alphanumeric characters before lookup** so `U.S.A.`, `U.S.`, `USA`, and `U S A` all collapse identically. Rows that don't match any canonical name or alias tag as `country_unresolved` (NOT `invalid`) so users can extend the aliases file. Reusable downstream for country filters.
   - **Address.** Use `libpostal` if installed. Country-aware parsing.

   Common mistake: overwriting the display column with the normalized version. Always keep raw alongside normalized.

4. **Validate field-by-field.** Per field, add a boolean `<field>_valid` and a `<field>_reason` text column when invalid. Tag invalid rows; never delete them.

   - **Emails:** RFC 5322 syntax via `email-validator`; role-address detection (`info@`, `sales@`, `noreply@`, `support@`, `hello@`); disposable-domain check; free-provider flag (`gmail`, `yahoo`, `qq`); optional MX-record check (off by default).
   - **Phones:** parse + format via `phonenumbers`. Tag `invalid_too_short`, `invalid_country`, `invalid_format`.
   - **Domains:** valid eTLD, no IP literals, optional MX check.
   - **Country codes:** valid ISO Alpha-2 after normalization.

5. **Hand off to entity resolution (optional).** This skill cleans rows in isolation; it cannot tell you that `Starbucks EMEA` and `Starbucks Corporation` point to the same company. If the user wants the handoff, produce a match-ready subset and route rows by available signal:

   - Rows with normalized company name + domain: route to **match a business** (name + website, falls back to domain-only on mismatch).
   - Rows with a corporate (not role / free-provider / disposable) email: route to **match a prospect** via email.
   - Rows with parsed person name + company name: route to **match a prospect** via name + company.
   - Rows with a validated LinkedIn URL: route to **match a prospect** via LinkedIn.

   Filter out tagged-invalid rows before the handoff so you do not spend credits matching `noreply@example.com` or disposable addresses. The returned IDs become the join keys for any later **enrich a business** or **enrich a prospect** call.

## Output Format

### Profile Snapshot
Per column: `fill_rate_pct`, `cardinality`, `top_value`, `avg_len`. Markdown table. After cleanup, re-run the profile and show before vs after on touched columns.

### Standardization Map
Per normalized field: raw column name, normalized column name, 3 to 5 example transformations (`"  ACME, Inc. "` to `acme`, `"WWW.Acme.COM"` to `acme.com`, `"+1 (415) 555 1212"` to `+14155551212`).

### Validation Verdict
Per validated field: counts of valid, invalid, risky. Frequency table of reason codes (e.g. `role_address: 42`, `disposable_domain: 18`, `invalid_syntax: 6`).

### Cleaned File
A single CSV at `./03_validated/<input_name>_clean.csv` with all original columns plus `<field>_norm`, `<field>_valid`, and `<field>_reason` columns.

### Match-Ready Subset (only if requested)
A second CSV at `./04_match_ready/<input_name>_for_match.csv` containing only rows that passed validation, plus a one-line summary of which match path each row subset should route to (count by path).

## Limitations

- Does NOT deduplicate or resolve to canonical entities. Two normalized strings can still refer to the same real-world business. Hand off to a match step for that.
- Person-name parsing is best-effort. Non-Western order, hyphenated families, and missing separators are flagged with a low-confidence marker; raw string is always preserved.
- The MX-record check requires DNS and adds 50 to 200ms per unique domain. Off by default.
- Free-email providers (gmail, yahoo) are flagged but cannot be linked to a corporate identity from this skill alone. Pair with a prospect match (email + company) when needed.
- Holding-company and subsidiary pitfalls are out of scope (`meta.com` vs `instagram.com` vs `whatsapp.com`). Resolve via company-hierarchies enrichment after matching.
- If the input lacks a country column entirely, phone normalization defaults to a permissive parser and may mis-format short numbers. Provide a default country in the user message when possible.
- Country lookup uses `pycountry` + the bundled `country_aliases.yaml`; unmatched rows tag as `country_unresolved` (NOT `invalid`) so users can extend the aliases file. Pre-strip non-alphanumeric characters before lookup so `U.S.A.` and `USA` collapse identically.
- The Input section defines a canonical JSON shape (`schema_hints`, `default_country`, `entity_type`, `mx_check`, `match_ready`). The agent must echo the parsed shape back as the first log line so the user can correct misreads before the workflow runs.
- Non-Western surname-first names (Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese romanized) get parsed backwards by `nameparser` without a low-confidence flag. The expanded confidence heuristic in step 3 (CJK/Hangul detection, surname-first lookup, credential suffix) stores both interpretations as `name_first` / `name_last` and `name_first_alt` / `name_last_alt` so downstream match can try both orderings.
